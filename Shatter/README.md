# Frozen Shader Shatter

This repository contains a super simple supplementary shatter script for the Frozen shader effect for Unity. The effect shatters an ice object into multiple chunks using basic instantiation.

## Customization

If you wish to implement a more complex mesh shatter library, you can replace the basic instantiation and explosion force techniques used in this script with your own solution. There are various mesh shattering libraries available for Unity that provide advanced features and more realistic shattering effects. You can explore and integrate these libraries into your project to achieve a higher level of complexity and visual fidelity.
